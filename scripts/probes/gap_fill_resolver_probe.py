"""Replay one question's gap-fill v1 gaps through free model routes and search context sizes.

Gap-fill v1 (``research/targeted.py``) answers each analyzer gap with one OpenRouter web-search
call built by ``build_native_search_llm``. Production uses a free-tier model route; this probe
compares that route with another free model and search context settings. This probe
takes the gaps the archive recorded for ONE question, sends each through the production
resolver path (the same prompt builder and the same LLM builder, with the model and the
context size overridden) at every ``model:context_size`` cell of a grid, and writes the
answers side by side with OpenRouter's own per-call cost and token counts, so the operator
can read what a cheaper cell gives up.

It makes outbound model/search requests and may incur provider-side search charges, which is why
it still refuses to run without ``--i-accept-spend`` and prints its ceiling first. The
Metaculus-donated key is never used: the probe forces
``DONATED_OPENROUTER_KEY_ENABLED=false`` before any LLM is built, the switch a Mantic run
uses, so every cost figure it records is the whole charge rather than a BYOK platform fee.
