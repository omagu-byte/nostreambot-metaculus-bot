"""Seam-pinning tests for the ``GeneralLlm`` -> ``litellm.acompletion`` kwarg funnel.

These lock down the behaviours the 0.2.54 -> 0.2.92 forecasting-tools upgrade is
known (or suspected) to silently break. Every test is GREEN on the currently
installed 0.2.54 and is written to keep the migration honest — if a seam here
goes red at 0.2.92, the migration touched something load-bearing.

Seams covered:

* **Kwarg funnel** (``TestProductionKwargShapesReachAcompletion``): our exact
  production kwarg shapes — ``reasoning={"effort": "xhigh"}``,
  ``extra_body={"verbosity": "high"}``, top-level ``verbosity``,
  ``plugins=[{"id": "web", ...}]`` + ``web_search_options``,
  ``response_format=<pydantic model>``, ``timeout`` — must reach
  ``acompletion`` byte-for-byte. ``GeneralLlm`` funnels everything via
  ``**self.litellm_kwargs`` today; if 0.2.92 adds param filtering or reshapes
  ``pass_through_unknown_kwargs`` these arrive mangled and the models silently
  run with the wrong reasoning effort / no web plugin / no structured output.

* **temperature default semantics** (``TestTemperatureNoneWorkaround``): pre-0.2.92
  the ctor default was ``temperature=0`` — so our reasoning configs pass
  ``temperature=None`` *explicitly* to keep a hard ``0`` from being injected
  (reasoning models degrade under an explicit sampling temperature). At 0.2.92 the
  ctor default flipped to ``None`` (revised here in W5), so that explicit ``None``
  is now redundant-but-harmless and is kept as a defensive pin against a future
  default flip. NOTE: ``temperature=None`` does NOT drop the key from the
  acompletion kwargs — the funnel forwards ``temperature=None`` and litellm (with
  ``drop_params``) strips the None value downstream. We pin the funnel behaviour we
  can observe: both the explicit ``None`` and the omitted arg reach the funnel as
  ``None`` at 0.2.92 (pre-0.2.92 the omitted arg injected ``0``).

* **litellm.drop_params global** (``TestDropParamsGlobal``): the agentic
  research loop calls raw ``acompletion`` and relies on ``litellm.drop_params``
  being ``True`` globally (``research/agentic/llm.py`` strips
  ``reasoning_effort`` for OpenRouter only because of it). ``GeneralLlm`` sets
  the global to ``True`` on its first real call — NOT at import — so this pins
  that a ``GeneralLlm`` invoke leaves the process-wide flag set.

* **FallbackOpenRouterLlm key swap** (``TestFallbackOpenRouterKeySwap``): a
  donated-key credential failure (401) must construct/route to a *second*
  ``GeneralLlm`` on the personal key and succeed; a 403 must NOT fall back. These
  drive the fake all the way down at the ``acompletion`` boundary (not at
  ``_invoke_once_using_primary``) so the real two-instance key funnel is
  exercised.

* **agentic tools-path executes under the installed litellm**
  (``TestAgenticToolsPathExecutesUnderLitellm``): the agentic gap-fill v2 loop is
  the ONLY caller that passes ``tools=`` to ``acompletion``. litellm >=1.92
  eagerly imports its proxy MCP-gateway handler — which needs ``fastapi``, a
  proxy-only extra we do NOT install — whenever ``tools=`` is present, BEFORE it
  checks whether MCP is actually in use. That import fired on v2's first call,
  crashed with ``ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'fastapi'`` (wrapped as
  ``APIConnectionError``), and the loop soft-failed to "" — so v2 (an always-on
  prod research feature) was SILENTLY DEAD with nothing red in CI. The fix
  (``research/agentic/llm.py`` passes ``_skip_mcp_handler=True``) skips that
  import. This test drives the REAL ``litellm.acompletion`` through the REAL
  production wrapper ``build_default_llm_call`` with a non-empty ``tools_json``
  (offline via ``mock_response`` — the mock short-circuits the network but the
  MCP import still fires because it is gated on ``tools=`` first), so it CRASHES
  if the skip kwarg is ever dropped. Unlike the shape-pins above, this pins that
  the tools-path can EXECUTE at all under the installed litellm — the exact gap
  that let the fastapi defect ship.

    """Wrap the REAL ``litellm.acompletion``, injecting ``mock_response``.

    The whole point of this indirection: ``build_default_llm_call``'s
    ``_call_once`` builds the kwargs dict internally and calls
    ``acompletion(**kwargs)`` against the ``acompletion`` symbol bound in
    ``research/agentic/llm.py``. We monkeypatch that symbol to this wrapper, which
    forwards to the genuine ``litellm.acompletion`` with ``mock_response`` added.
    That keeps the REAL litellm call executing — so litellm's ``tools=``-gated
    eager import of its proxy MCP-gateway handler still fires (``mock_response``
    only short-circuits the network, AFTER that import). A plain ``AsyncMock``
    here would defeat the whole test by skipping the import entirely.

    Returns the wrapper plus a ``calls`` list recording each forwarded call's
    kwargs, so a test can assert what actually reached ``litellm.acompletion``
    (specifically that a non-empty ``tools=`` did — the seam only fires on that).
