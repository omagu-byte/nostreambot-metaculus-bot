"""Tests for the extracted ResearchOrchestrator.

Verifies that the orchestrator:
1. Delegates to providers correctly
2. Handles caching (benchmarking mode)
3. Runs gap-fill when enabled
4. Combines parallel provider results with headers
5. Falls back gracefully on provider failure
6. Exposes provider_failure_count for alerting
