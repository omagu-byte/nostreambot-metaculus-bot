"""Tests for the tracked question-supply probe (scripts/supply_probe.py), Metaculus mode.

Fixtures are the dict builders in ``tests/supply_probe_fakes.py``, shaped like the Metaculus
posts-list payload the probe pages. The Mantic mode (``--platform mantic``: public reads, the
optional token, the spot-time snapshot and the per-release-hour miss table) is covered in
``tests/test_supply_probe_mantic.py``.

The situation they model is the one this utility exists for. On 2026-08-31 the summer
tournament held 178 posts at status ``closed`` (closed to forecasting, not yet
resolved), 26 of them the frozen-triple checkpoint cohort, 16 of those already past their
own ``scheduled_resolve_time`` and the worst by 17.1 days — none of which two consecutive
rounds' supply projections could see, because their scratch probes queried only
``statuses=resolved`` and ``statuses=open``. The exact-numbers replay of that census
against these functions is a separate offline check (see the round-census validation under
``scratch/next_season_bundle_2026-09/19c/``); what is pinned here is the behavior.

No live API: every test drives the pure functions directly or monkeypatches the probe's
single HTTP entry point, and the autouse egress guard in tests/conftest.py would raise on
any real connect anyway.

        constant, so an override arriving with the .env files (nothing loads `.env.local` at
        import time) moved POSTS_URL and left the vetted host at www.metaculus.com. Simulated
